			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					I am a Computer Science student at the University of North Texas,
					currently based in Fort Worth. My academic journey has been defined by
					a commitment to excellence, maintaining a spot on the President's List
					since my first semester. I am passionate about building impactful
					technology and enjoy spending my free time exploring everything from
					systems programming to sci-fi literature. I'm always looking for the
					next challenge that piques my interest. I am currently looking for an internship, let's connect!

					<div class="SkillBox">
						<h3>C++</h3>
						<p>
							I have written many projects in C++ and have about a year and a
							half of experience with the language. One of the projects is the
							course project mentioned below in the projects section.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="SkillBox">
						<h3>Python</h3>
						<p>
							I have about 5 years of Python experience and have written many
							projects with it. One of the most recent projects is the IoT
							Malware Detection project, which is mentioned below in the project
							section.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="SkillBox">
						<h3>Caddy</h3>
						<p>
							I have used Caddy to host this website after installing and
							configuring it for my web server.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div style="display: inline grid">
					<div class="SkillBox">
						<h3>Linux</h3>
						<p>
							I have used linux for many things and have even ran it as a daily
							driver for more than 5 years. As such I have had to troubleshoot
							many things in linux and have discovered how to configure many
							systems within linux.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="SkillBox">
						<h3>GitHub</h3>
						<p>
							I have used Git and GitHub to manage many of my projects that
							might require significant time to work on, or that need input from
							other people. The IoT Malware Detection Survey project below used
							GitHub to help organize all the code we wrote for the paper so
							that anyone interested may see what we did.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="SkillBox">
						<h3>Pytorch</h3>
						<p>
							I have used this for one project, which was the IoT Malware
							Detection Survey, as we had to create ML models for that. I had to
							create a CNN that would take statistical data from a graph to
							determine if a program was malware.

								This project was to find out the problems that currently exist
								while trying to replicate Artificial Intelligence research. For
								this, we replicated some research papers about IoT malware
								detection and discovered issues that were in the papers. Some
								did not have an available dataset and therefore could not be
								properly replicated. The research was conducted during the UNT
								AI Summer Research Program in 2025. We have yet to finish
								finalizing the paper, but we currently have a poster showing our
								results. The poster was also presented at the UNT University
								Research Day. The current version of the poster can be found<a
									type="application/pdf"

						<p>
							This project was designed to help me understand how graphs could
							be used in a real scenario. The scenario was to design 3
							algorithms that an airline or travel site might want. The first
							algorithm was to find the path with at most a certain number of
							connecting flights. The second algorithm was to find the path that
							had the fewest connecting flights between two cities that also
							included two other cities. The last algorithm was to find a city
							that had the fewest connecting flights from three other cities. If
							you would like to learn more about the project, you can visit the
