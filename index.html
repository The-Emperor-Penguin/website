        <p>
          I am currently live in Roanoke, TX and am perusing a Bachelors of
          Science at the University of North Texas. I have lived in Texas most of
          my life and it has become like home. I like reading books, here are some
          of them: Dune, 1984, The Grapes of Wrath, and A Game of Thrones. #MAYBE

          I am currently persuing a Bachalors of Science at the University of
          North Texas. I have done many courses including Data Structures and
          Foundations of computing. I also participated in the UNT AI Summer
          Research Program in 2025. There I worked on a system that was trained
          to detect malware on IoT devices. If you would like to see more about
          the project please check out my GitHub above.

          Besides my education I have worked on some small scale projects for
          fun such as my Ultra High Compression Ratio project that is able to
          _____________.
